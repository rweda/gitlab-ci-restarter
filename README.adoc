= GitLab CI Job Restarter
:gitlab-runner: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner[GitLab Runner]

Fault-tolerant CI.

If your {gitlab-runner} is killed -
maybe the configuration needed to be changed, or an autoscaler decided to consolidate the number of runners -
then all running jobs are killed with a less-than-useful message:

The job restarter listens for jobs that failed due to the {gitlab-runner} stopping,
and can retry them.

The restarter can be configured to limit the number of times jobs can be automatically retried,
preventing a job that crashes the runner from continuously bringing down the infrastructure.

In addition, the restarter can avoid retrying long-running jobs,
ensuring that using large amounts of resources only occurs when directly triggered by a user.
